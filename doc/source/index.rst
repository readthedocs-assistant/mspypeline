Usage
=====

| ``mspypeline`` was developed for the analysis of proteomic data generated by **MaxQuant** to provide a
  tool to analyze complex datasets in a standardized manner with minimal effort and to eliminate the chance of human
  error or obscuring variability during data analysis.
| Designed with an intuitive and concise graphical user interface (GUI), ``mspypeline`` offers researchers,
  unfamiliar with programming or data analysis, the opportunity to explore and visualize their data independently and in
  a time-effective manner. A structured workflow (see figure to the left) can be followed to perform a comprehensive and
  conclusive analysis that starts with quality control of the data, followed by the assessment and choice of
  data pre-processing operations to finally allow optimal exploratory analysis. By automizing the calculation and
  generation of versatile figures ``mspypeline`` supports a comprehensive and conclusive data analysis within minutes.
  Simultaneously, the more experienced user may interact closer with the ``mspypeline`` package to perform advanced
  analysis exploiting the plethora of customization options.
| Standardization and reproducibility of the analysis are ensured by the automated logging of all analysis settings and
  saving them to a separate configuration file.
| Thus, ``mspypeline`` provides a platform that supports users in their proteomics data generated by mass spectrometry
  analysis by giving insight into the data, offering parameter adaptation when needed, generating custom figures and by
  reaching biologically relevant conclusions through differential expression analysis and hypothesis testing.
