Usage
=====

| The ``mspypeline`` was developed to consolidate the proteomics data analysis workflow while providing both simplicity
  and flexibility for the user.
| Designed with an intuitive and concise graphical user interface (GUI), the ``mspypeline`` offers researchers,
  unfamiliar with programming or data analysis, the opportunity to explore and visualize their data independently and in
  a time-effective manner. Simultaneously, the more experienced user may interact closer with the ``mspypeline`` to
  perform advanced analysis leveraging the plethora of customization options.
| Thus, the ``mspypeline`` provides a platform that supports users with their proteomics data analysis by giving insight
  into the data, offering parameter adaptation when needed, generating custom figures and by reaching biological
  relevant conclusions through differential expression analysis and hypothesis testing.
